# Free, Student-Run Clinic Intake System
This system was built to allow free, student-run clinics to effectively collect structured data on their patient populations for the purposes of research and qualtiy improvement.  Data collection is performed through a completely electronic form that can either serve as a replacement for or be used in addition to the current check-in form.  This intake system was built by volunteer students at the University of Alabama free, student-run clinic [Equal Access Birmingham](http://www.uab.edu/medicine/eab/) and is currently running on a local network at the clinic.

## Purpose
The original design of the system focused on three goals listed below in order of importance:

1. Providing a completely electronic form for collecting patient data for research
2. Storing patient data in as structured a manner as possible for easier retrieval
3. Displaying limited views of patient information for clinical workflow

## Features

* **Patient Search** - searches for patients by name and dob allowing patient data to be viewed in several forms
* **Returning Patient Form** - allows patient information to be updated
* **Clinical Summary** - specific view of patient data that provides relevant medical information for clinical workflow
* **Social Services Summary** - specific view of patient data that provides relevant information for social service workers
* **Research Data Dumps** - provide whole CSV dumps of database information for easy data retrieval
  * **Patient Demographics Data**
  * **Patient Social History Data**
  * **Patient Visit Information Data**
  * **Date of LastMammogram**
  * **Date of Last Secxually Transmitted Infection**
